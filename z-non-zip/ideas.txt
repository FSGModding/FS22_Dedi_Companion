update tic

set to pull strings from xml every 15 min or so and post in chat.



Maybe use this to monitor a folder for new chats from bot?

Have it watch for new files, pull the data, send chat message, then delete, repeat.

		local shaderFolder = "data/shaders/"
		local files = Files.new(shaderFolder).files

		for _, file in ipairs(files) do
			addReplacedCustomShader(file.filename, shaderFolder .. file.filename)
		end
